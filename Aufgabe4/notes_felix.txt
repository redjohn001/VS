The paper describes Google's new data-warehouse system called Mesa, which was built to handle the ever increasing amount of data, while providing
consistency and ability to query data in near-realtime. It scales across multiple data centers and can process big amounts of data while being able
to respond to queries incedibly fast. Mesa is also continously generated and maintains ACID properties. The main reason for the development of Mesa 
was to handle Google's ad buisness, but it can also function as a generic data warehouse system for other use cases.

Mesa
- Google has published a paper describing their new data-warehouse system used internally by Google called Mesa. 
  Mesa scales across multiple data centers and processes petabytes of data, while being able to respond to queries in sub-second time and maintain ACID properties.
  Mesa was designed mainly around Google’s advertising use-case. 
  Google built Mesa to be able to handle the ever increasing amount of data, while providing consistency and ability to query data in near-realtime.

- Mesa is a distributed, replicated, and highly available data processing, 
storage, and query system for structured data.
- Generic data warehouseing solution that statisfies all requirements

Storage system:
- continuously generated - andere systeme werden z.b. nur einmal am tag geupdated
- data is maintained using tables => table schema specifies structure
- key and value columns
- updates and queries:
  - updates in batches; batches are create by an upstream system in
    a frequency of a few minutes
    => smaller and more frequent batches 
       - would imply lower update latency
       - higher resource consumption
 - update automacity => multi-versioned approach
